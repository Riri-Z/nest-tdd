Thoses TDD principles will be respected :

1. You are not allowed to write any production code until you have first written a failing unit test.
2. You are not allowed to write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail — and not compiling is failing.
3. You are not allowed to write more production code that is sufficient to pass the currently failing unit test
